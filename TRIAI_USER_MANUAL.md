## 👋 Welcome to TriAI

TriAI is a powerful "Command Center" that lets you talk to the world's 4 smartest AIs at the same time. 

Instead of opening 4 different tabs and copying-and-pasting your question back and forth, TriAI sends your question to everyone instantly and shows you the answers side-by-side.

**Why is this cool?**
*   **GPT-5.2** is great for reasoning and logic.
*   **Claude 4.5** is amazing at writing and coding.
*   **Gemini 3.0** is creative and visually smart.
*   **Perplexity (Sonar)** searches the live internet for real-time news.

By seeing all 4 together, you get the absolute best answer every time.

## 🏛️ Council Mode 2.0 (The Expert Suite)

TriAI isn't just about "chatting." You can assign **Expert Roles** to each AI to force them to think like professionals.

**New Business Suite Roles:** (See full list in [ROLES_REFERENCE.md](ROLES_REFERENCE.md))
*   **🤝 Sales Engineer:** Uses MEDDIC logic to handle objections and close deals.
*   **⚖️ General Counsel:** Reviews contracts, IP strategy, and corporate liability.
*   **📱 Social Media Manager:** Writes viral hooks for LinkedIn/X without the "AI fluff."
*   **� Telecom Pro:** Field-level provisioning for Ciena, Fujitsu, and Cisco gear.
*   **🧠 Prompt Architect:** Writes perfect system prompts for *other* AIs.

**The "War Room" Protocol:**
For high-stakes crisis management, activate the "War Room." This assigns adversarial roles (Liquidator, Devil's Advocate, Spy Master) to stress-test your strategy against "Black Swan" events.

## 🧠 The Learning Engine (Scoring)

TriAI gets smarter the more you use it.

1.  **Rate Responses:** After receiving answers, you can give each AI a **Star Rating (1-5)**.
2.  **System Learning:** The internal database records which model/role combination performed best for that specific type of question (e.g., "The Sales Engineer role on Claude is best for cold emails").
3.  **Auto-Recommendations:** Next time you ask a similar question, TriAI will **automatically suggest** the highest-rated Council configuration for you.

## 🎯 Sniper Mode & Interrogation

See something interesting (or suspicious) in an answer?

1.  **Highlight the text** with your mouse.
2.  A "Glass Menu" appears instantly.
3.  **Click "Interrogate":** This forces the AI to defend that specific sentence.
4.  **Click "Blueprint/Art":** Generates technical schematics or realistic visualizations of the highlighted concept.

## ⚡ Pro Tips

*   **For News**: Always look at the **Teal (Perplexity)** box. It's the only one that sees the live internet.
*   **For Writing**: **Orange (Claude)** is usually the best writer. Use his answer for emails or essays.
*   **For Logic/Math**: **Green (OpenAI)** is hard to beat on reliable logic.
*   **Adversarial Truth**: If an AI is being too polite or "sandbagging," the system will flag it with a ⚠️ Yellow Alert. Use the **Interrogation** tool to force the truth out.
