## 👋 Welcome to TriAI

TriAI is a powerful "Command Center" that lets you talk to the world's 4 smartest AIs at the same time. 

Instead of opening 4 different tabs and copying-and-pasting your question back and forth, TriAI sends your question to everyone instantly and shows you the answers side-by-side.

**Why is this cool?**
*   **GPT-5.2** is great for reasoning and logic.
*   **Claude 4.5** is amazing at writing and coding.
*   **Gemini 3.0** is creative and visually smart.
*   **Perplexity (Sonar)** searches the live internet for real-time news.

By seeing all 4 together, you get the absolute best answer every time.

## 🎮 How to Use It

### 1. The Basics: "Compare Mode"
This is the default screen. 
1.  **Type a question** in the big box at the top.
2.  **Hit Enter** (or click "Ask All AIs").
3.  **Watch the magic**: You'll see 4 colored panels light up as different AIs race to answer you.
    *   Top Left (Green): **OpenAI**
    *   Top Right (Orange): **Claude**
    *   Bottom Left (Blue): **Gemini**
    *   Bottom Right (Teal): **Perplexity**

### 2. Council Mode 👥 ("Assigning Jobs")
Want to get serious? You can assign specific "jobs" to each AI so they work as a team.
1.  Click the **"Council"** button (or "Roles").
2.  Choose a preset like **"Startup Launch"** or **"Debate Team"**.
3.  Now, instead of just answering, they will act like experts:
    *   One might be the **Optimist**.
    *   One might be the **Critic** (finding holes in your plan).
    *   One might be the **Researcher**.
    *   One might be the **Strategist**.

### 3. Visualizations 📊 & 🎨
TriAI doesn't just write text; it can draw!
*   **Charts**: If you ask for data (like "Show me the revenue growth of Apple vs Microsoft"), you'll see a small **📊 Chart Icon** on the response cards. Click it to see a professional graph.
*   **Blueprints & Art**: 
    1.  Highlight ANY text in an answer.
    2.  A "Glass Menu" will pop up.
    3.  Click **"Blueprint"** 📐 to create a technical schematic.
    4.  Click **"Art"** 🖼️ to generate a realistic image of that concept.

### 4. Sniper Mode 🎯
See something interesting in an answer?
1.  **Highlight the text** with your mouse.
2.  A small menu appears instantly.
3.  You can ask **"Interrogate"** to deep-dive into *just* that specific sentence.
4.  This is great for fact-checking or expanding on a specific idea without re-typing everything.

## ⚡ Pro Tips

*   **For News**: Always look at the **Teal (Perplexity)** box. It's the only one that can see the live internet today.
*   **For Writing**: **Orange (Claude)** is usually the best writer. Use his answer for emails or essays.
*   **For Logic/Math**: **Green (OpenAI)** is hard to beat on reliable logic.
*   **Hard Mode**: If the AIs are being too polite or "waffling," turn on **Hard Mode**. This forces them to be direct, decisive, and stop apologizing.
