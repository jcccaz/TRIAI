# Next Session Plan: The "Risky Persona" & Conflict Stress-Test

## 0. Visual Refinement (The "Fidelity" Test) 🎨
- **Goal**: Confirm that the "Concept Fidelity" update ensures diagrams match technical prompts accurately.
- **Action**: Test complex architectural concepts (e.g. "Distributed Mesh Network with 5% packet loss") and verify if the visuals show the actual components.

## 1. Conflict Simulation (The "Risky" Persona Test) ⚔️
- **Goal**: Evaluate model performance in zero-sum, high-pressure scenarios.
- **Action**: Use the newly added `Crisis Negotiator` and `Hostile Takeover Specialist` roles.
- **Focus**: Does the "negotiator" actually provide de-escalation scripts? Does the "specialist" find aggressive leverage?

## 2. Document Analysis Integration 📁
- **Goal**: Finish the Phase 1.3 of the Enhancement Plan.
- **Action**: Implement text extraction for uploaded PDFs and images.
- **Focus**: Pass document context into the Council for forensic analysis.

## 3. Railway Deployment 🚀
- **Goal**: Push the new Visual Persistent Layer and The Fabricator to the mobile Railway app.

## 🏁 Summary of Achievements (Feb 2, 2026)
- ✅ **The Fabricator Live**: Integrated a two-step LLM prompt refinement system for visuals.
- ✅ **Image Persistence Layer**: Images are now saved locally to `static/img/fabricated/`.
- ✅ **Zero-Text Protocol**: Strictly enforced (No AI-gibberish, only color-coded logic).
- ✅ **Concept Fidelity Priority**: Forced the engine to prioritize literal accuracy over pure aesthetics.
- ✅ **Expanded Visual Triggers**: Direct detection of "diagram", "schematic", "blueprint", "render", etc.
- ✅ **Stable Bridge**: Hardened OpenAI client initialization and fixed blueprint registration bugs.

**Current State**: Visuals are permanent, tactical, and conceptually accurate. The "War Room" infrastructure is ready for the next level of forensic analysis.
