# Next Session Plan: The "Risky Persona" & Conflict Stress-Test

## 0. Conflict Simulation (The "Risky" Persona Test) ⚔️
- **Goal**: Evaluate model performance in zero-sum, high-pressure scenarios.
- **Action**: Use the newly added `Crisis Negotiator` and `Hostile Takeover Specialist` roles.
- **Focus**: Does the "negotiator" actually provide de-escalation scripts? Does the "specialist" find aggressive leverage?

## 1. Persona Mapping (The "Drift" Analysis) 🗺️
- **Goal**: Visualize where models "drift" when given the freedom to self-select.
- **Action**: Add a "Persona Map" to the Learning Dashboard.
  - Count frequency of self-selected personas across categories.
  - Identify "Vibe-Only" models vs. "Depth-Only" models (Identity building vs. Substance).

## 2. Dynamic Model Swapping (Manual Force) 🔄
- **Goal**: Allow manual assignment of roles (Designer, Critic, etc.) to specific models (e.g., "Force GPT as the Critic").
- **Research focus**: Does a model perform better as a "Writer" or an "Editor"?

## 3. Railway Deployment 🚀
- **Goal**: Push all these "Self-Selection" and "Sandbagging" features to the mobile Railway app.

## 5. Summary of Achievements (Jan 31, 2026)
- ✅ **Hard Mode & "Expert Intensity" Level 2**: Added "Hard Mode" toggle with Total Persona Lockdown (Zero AI-isms).
- ✅ **Self-Selecting Expert Mode**: Models choose their own elite identities (e.g., Dr. Sylvie Dubois).
- ✅ **Anti-Sandbagging Protocol**: UI Badge + Prompt Pressure to stop models from "hiding" depth in thoughts.
- ✅ **Database "Thought" Memory**: Permanently storing reasoning traces for historical audit.
- ✅ **Persona Paradox Research**: Documented the "Branding vs. Substance" divergence in the White Paper.
- ✅ **UI Header Integration**: Real-time persona reflecting in card titles.

**Current Branch**: `feature/council-mode` (Synchronized with local "Beast Mode" state)
