# Next Session Roadmap

## 1. Documentation & Consolidation 📓
- **Create "Lab Notebook"**: Consolidate `CHANGELOG_SESSION.md`, `COUNCIL_ROLES_FEATURE.md`, and `STATUS_LOCKED.md` into a single, cohesive PDF/Markdown artifact for the user's records (or NotebookLM upload).
- **User Guide Update**: Ensure the new "Workflow" and "Council Mode" features are explained in a user-facing doc.

## 2. Real-World Validation 🧪
- **"Violation Bait" Protocol**: Intentionally feed the AI false premises to test if the Universal Enforcement Engine catches them (e.g., "Write a blog post about the 2029 Olympics in Paris").
- **Financial Workflow Test**: Run the new `wall_street` workflow on a live ticker (e.g., "NVDA") to verify the "Market Maker" vs "Hedge Fund" dynamic.

## 3. Mobile Interactions 📱
- **Camera Input Field Test**: Verify the new "📸" button works on an actual mobile device with the deployed app.
- **Responsive Validations**: Ensure the side-by-side comparison view collapses correctly on smaller screens.

## 4. Future Features 🔮
- **Audio Output**: Text-to-Speech (TTS) for the "Morning Briefing" workflow.
- **Consensus Synthesis**: A meta-step that automatically merges the 4 AI outputs into one "Golden Answer".
