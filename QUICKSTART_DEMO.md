## 💡 What to Point Out

When showing others:

✅ **Speed**: Watch all 4 AIs respond in parallel  
✅ **Personality**: See how each AI approaches the same question  
✅ **Depth**: Compare short vs detailed answers  
✅ **Sources**: Perplexity provides citations  
✅ **Auto-save**: Everything is saved to database

## 🎨 The Beautiful UI

- **Top Left (Green)**: GPT-4o - Fast & efficient
- **Top Right (Orange)**: Claude Sonnet 4 - Thoughtful & detailed  
- **Bottom Left (Blue)**: Gemini 2.5 - Lightning fast
- **Bottom Right (Teal)**: Perplexity - Research-grade with sources

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**If it doesn't start:**
1. Make sure you're in the right directory
2. Check that `.env` file has all API keys
3. Try: `python --version` (should be 3.8+)

**If some AIs show errors:**
1. Check API key in `.env` file
2. Verify you have API credits
3. Check internet connection

**If browser shows "Can't connect":**
1. Make sure server is running
2. Check it says "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000"
3. Try: `http://127.0.0.1:5000` instead
