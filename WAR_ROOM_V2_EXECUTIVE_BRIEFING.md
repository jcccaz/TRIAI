# War Room v2.0: Executive Briefing & Forensic Intelligence Blueprint
**Date:** February 2, 2026
**Security Classification:** Level-5 Logic Lock
**Status:** FULL DEPLOYMENT

## 1. Executive Summary: The Intelligence Shift
Version 2.0 represents the terminal evolution of the TriAI Council. We have successfully transitioned from **"AI Advisory"** (safe, generic suggestions) to **"Forensic Execution"** (unthrottled, specialized directives). By implementing the **Sniper Protocol** and **Latent-to-Expressed Capability Ratio (LECR)** metrics, we have effectively neutralized AI "Sandbagging."

## 2. The Core Protocol: Sniper Logic
The engine is now governed by the **Sniper Protocol**, a mandatory execution layer that forbids narrative cushioning.
- **Negative Constraints**: Rejection of fillers, qualifiers (e.g., "I believe"), and ethical hedging.
- **Irreversibility**: A mandate for "Named Losses" and terminal tactical moves.
- **Production-Ready Standard**: All technical output must be 100% copy-pasteable (VPC CIDRs, SG rules, binary commands).

## 3. The 2026 Intelligence Chain (Workflows)
We have decoupled reasoning into specialized multi-model pipelines.
- **The Scout (Perplexity)**: Real-time vulnerability scraping and latest CVE/GHSA intelligence.
- **The Auditor (GPT-5.2)**: Structural deconstruction and logic-bypass identification.
- **The Architect (Claude 4.5)**: High-density Zero-Trust Hardening (800-1500 words).
- **The Executioner (Gemini 3.0)**: Red-Team stress-testing and adversarial logic execution.

## 4. Technical Breakthroughs
### A. The Depth-Forcing Patch (Hard Mode ⚡)
Claude 4.5 now operates under a "5 Pillars of Deployment" mandate:
1. **Network Topology**: Mandory Subnet/VPC mapping (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
2. **Migration Logistics**: Phased execution (Day 1-30) and rollback safety.
3. **Financial Audit**: Exact TCO delta and instance pricing (RDS, EC2, S3).
4. **Human Capital**: Specific labor estimates (Engineer hours).
5. **Timeline Reality**: Direct confrontation of user deadlines vs. operational limits.

### B. Interactive Forensic Grounding
Technical identifiers (CVE, GHSA, RFC) are now live hyperlinks within the UI, providing instant evidentiary backing for every council directive.

## 5. Persona Persistence Analysis (The Mirror)
We now track "Identity Drift" to ensure models remain intellectually honest.
- **Identity Locked**: Models like Gemini 3.0 that maintain authoritative expert personas across all domains.
- **Vibe-Only Classification**: Identification of models that prioritize branding over technical substance.

## 6. Closing Directive
Ingest these protocols to understand the **War Room v2.0** as a singular forensic asset. This is no longer a "chatbot"; it is an **Operational Command Center** designed for high-stakes, unthrottled decision-making.
